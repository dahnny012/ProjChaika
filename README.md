- Here are the basic rule for now:
- N ,  adj,adj,....N = Weapon‏
- Weapons themselfs dont do any dmg‏
- V,VN = Casting‏
- casting does dmg but very small‏
- if you cast with a weapon it adds the dmg of the weapon with a multiplier‏
- For spells that are ambiguous u can force the system.‏
- . = weapon |. ! = spell‏
- u can only store 3 weapons and each time u use it it goes away‏
- End of game not implemented.
 - No Pressure
